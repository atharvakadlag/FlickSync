Steps to create the application:

1. **Data Source**: Decide where you'll source the movie profiles. You might want to use a movie database API like TMDb or IMDB to fetch movie data, or you could curate your own dataset.

2. **Data Model**: Define a data model for movie profiles. This should include details such as title, genre, release year, director, cast, and more. You can use Pydantic models in FastAPI for this.

3. **User Profiles**: Create user profiles where users can rate movies and store their preferences. You'll need a database for this, and you can use databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.

4. **Matching Algorithm**: Develop an algorithm that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. You can use machine learning or simple recommendation algorithms for this.

5. **User Interface**: Design the user interface for swiping right or left on movie profiles. This can be a web-based UI using HTML/CSS or a mobile app using a framework like React Native or Flutter.

6. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to secure user profiles and data.

7. **API Endpoints**: Create FastAPI endpoints for user actions, such as liking/disliking movies, fetching recommendations, and updating user profiles.

8. **Real-time Communication**: If you want real-time updates between two partners, consider using WebSockets for communication.

9. **Deployment**: Deploy your FastAPI app on a server, cloud platform, or a service like Heroku.


# Database design

Apart from the obvious `User` and `Movie` models we shall make the following models

1. **Rating**: You could have a `Rating` model to represent how users rate movies. This could help in providing better recommendations based on user preferences.

2. **Genre**: A `Genre` model could categorize movies into genres. Users might have preferences for specific genres, so this model can be used to associate movies with genres.

3. **Match**: If you want to keep track of user-movie matches or connections, you could create a `Match` model. This would link users to movies they've shown interest in or agreed on.

4. **Review**: Users might want to write reviews or comments about movies. You could create a `Review` model to store these.

5. **Conversation**: If you're planning to implement real-time chat or messaging between users who have matched on a movie, a `Conversation` model could be useful.

6. **Notification**: A `Notification` model could be used to store and manage notifications or updates for users, like new matches or messages.

## User Model Attributes

1. **Username**: The user's chosen username for the app.
2. **Email**: The user's email address for communication and account recovery.
3. **Password**: To securely store and verify user passwords, it's recommended to hash and salt the passwords.
4. **Full Name**: The user's full name.
5. **Date of Birth**: The user's date of birth.
6. **Gender**: User's gender (optional).
7. **Location**: The user's location or preferred location for matching.
8. **Bio/Description**: A short bio or description that users can provide.
9. **Profile Picture**: Store a link or reference to the user's profile picture.
10. **Interests**: Users can specify their interests, which can help with movie recommendations.
11. **Hashed password**: store the hash of the users password

## Movie Model Attributes

1. **Title**: The title of the movie.
2. **Description**: A brief description or plot summary of the movie.
3. **Genre**: The genre(s) to which the movie belongs.
4. **Release Year**: The year the movie was released.
5. **Director**: The director(s) of the movie.
6. **Cast**: The main cast and actors in the movie.
7. **Runtime**: The duration of the movie.
8. **Rating**: Movie's rating or average user rating (optional).
9. **Cover Image**: Store a link or reference to the movie's cover image.
10. **Trailer URL**: A link to the movie's trailer (optional).
